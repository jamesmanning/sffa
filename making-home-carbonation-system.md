There are various YouTube videos you can find that go over these bits, but here&#8217;s a text version in case it&#8217;s of any use to someone. ðŸ™‚

1) acquire parts

  * the CO2 tank is the most expensive part, and [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLFvw4CVKgY) says you can find them at a junkyard for free. Others say you can pick one up from a welding supply company. I just got mine with the rest of the parts on amazon. If you do acquire an older one, make sure [the most recent date of the tank being tested is fairly recent](https://www.atlanticbrewsupply.com/CO2-Refills-and-BeerGas-Nitrogen-Exchanges_ep_50.html), since the tank has to be tested every 5 years (if it&#8217;s been over 5 years, places aren&#8217;t supposed to fill it until it&#8217;s been tested). The brand of the tank doesn&#8217;t matter, so while the one I bought was supposed to say &#8220;Kegco&#8221; on it, the one I received didn&#8217;t have that, but it doesn&#8217;t matter, the date-tested was only a couple months previous, which was the important part. While you can get bigger or smaller tanks, the 5 pound size seems reasonable and a fill of it should handle carbonating hundreds if not thousands of bottles.
  * make sure to get a stainless/metal carbonation cap (adapter for the 2L bottles). There are plastic ones, especially the CarbaCap, and it might work fine for some people, but whether due to manufacturing variation or not, it worked quite badly for me. Difficult to get on and off the bottle, leaks at higher pressures, difficult to get the ball lock on it. The stainless one I got has been a dream in comparison.
  * get a dual-gauge regulator instead of a single-gauge one so you can more easily tell when your CO2 gets low. The 2 gauges tell you 1) how much pressure is left in the tank and 2) how much pressure is going out of the line (what you&#8217;ll be putting into the bottle).
  * the tanks/regulators/lines/ball locks all seem to be standardized, which helps make it easier. ðŸ™‚

Just as a reference, the parts I got off amazon:

  * [regulator](http://amzn.com/B003WX772G)

2) fill CO2 tank

The CO2 tank is most likely empty (unless you bought a full one locally, I suppose), so you&#8217;ll need to find a local place to get it filled. Home-brew supply stores and welding supply stores appear to be the most common recommendation. The cheapest I found locally was $14 to fill my 5 pound CO2 tank, but prices will vary based on location.

Take gloves with you, since a freshly filled CO2 tank is INCREDIBLY cold, as you might imagine.

If you go to a friendly enough place to get the CO2 tank filled and ask nicely, they&#8217;ll help put the regulator on the tank after it&#8217;s filled and maybe even push the line on the regulator for you. If not, those are pretty simple to do yourself as well, although you&#8217;d need a sufficiently large wrench to get the regulator tightened onto the tank.

3) If not already done while filling the tank, assemble parts

The regulator attaches onto the CO2 tank. It worked fine in a quick test with just finger-tightening for me, but I&#8217;d highly recommend using a wrench to get it on there better.

The gas line will push onto the regulator output. It might take some effort, but you should be able to get it on. The line should come with 2 clamps, and move them to either end of the line and tighten them to secure it to the regulator and to the ball lock mechanism.

4) test out putting the ball lock mechanism onto the carbonation adapter

Find an empty 2L bottle to test with and twist the carbonation cap/adapter on it. Then put the ball lock onto the carbonation adapter. The ball lock will probably have a collar you need to pull back for this to work. For mine, there are 4 ball bearings that prevent it from going on until the collar is pulled back. Holding the collar back, you&#8217;ll push the ball lock down until it goes all the way onto the adapter. It might take some effort, but with practice you&#8217;ll get used to the right amount of force needed.

While it&#8217;s like this, go ahead and take this opportunity to adjust the regulator to control what the pressure setting is. For my regulator, it&#8217;s a screw in the middle I turn with a wrench to adjust the pressure level. Your regulator might come with the setting all the way down, so if the regulator shows pressure from the tank but none going out of the line, then you&#8217;ll need to adjust the pressure level. The pressure level you want to use will depend on your goal for fizziness, with SodaStream-type mechanisms usually targeting around 15psi, and many people doing this kind of setup doing 30 to 40 psi. I wouldn&#8217;t go above 40, personally.

5) fill bottle (mostly full, leave space for expansion) with COLD water (colder the better it&#8217;ll accept the carbonation), then carbonate it

Now that you can put the ball lock onto the carbonation adapter, take the adapter off the bottle and fill it with water. If you&#8217;re going to flavor the water, you could do that ahead of time so that the shaking you do will both add carbonation and help mix up the flavor with the water. However, it&#8217;ll likely be a bit harder to see the bubbles happening during the carbonation if you add flavoring, so it&#8217;s a trade-off. You&#8217;ll want to squeeze out the air left in the bottle before adding the carbonation adapter, so that after the CO2 is hooked up, the air-space left is all CO2 and maximizes the

The actual carbonation goes much faster if you agitate the water. You can hold the bottle upside-down, right side-up, or sideways. I&#8217;ve tried different methods but usually do upside-down or side-to-side these days.

Some videos showing people shaking as examples:
