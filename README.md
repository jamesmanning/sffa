For most visitors to this site, there's a fairly natural progression of the pages here to help guide you.

  1. [explaining what food addiction is](what-is-food-addiction.md)
  2. [evaluating whether you may have food addiction](do-you-have-food-addiction.md)
  3. [explaining what soylent is](what-is-soylent.md)
  4. [why soylent for treating food addiction?](soylent-for-treating-food-addiction.md)
  5. [why exercise might be counterproductive](exercise-is-bad-for-weight-loss.md)
  6. [Other tips and tricks](figure-out-what-works-for-you.md)

I have [an about page](about.md) as well, but that's more about me than the idea, of course. :)
